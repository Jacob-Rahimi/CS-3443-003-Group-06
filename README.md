# Command Cyber's Open STIG
Our team here at Command Cyber has developed OpenSTIG, which is a tool designed around the Defense Information Systems Agencyâ€™s (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) that allows users to view, filter, and download STIGs. The main improvements that our application provides compared to the tools that DISA offers is that our application allows STIGs to be downloaded from the application and it is open source to allow users to modify this application to add additional features or incorporate it into their own application.

## Known Bugs
[comment]: <> (List any known bugs by the deadline of the project)
* <b>Main Menu Size Error:</b><br>
  *When switching from local/online catalouges, the size of the main menu screen can become warped. To recreate:*
    * Go to local catalouge. View a catalouge. Switch to online catalouge. Go to main menu.<br><br>
    <b>Possible fixes:</b>
    * Setting a minimum/maximum size limit to the stage at the start using primaryStage.setMinHeight(), primaryStage.setMinWidth(), primaryStage.setMaxHeight(), and primaryStage.setMaxWidth() functions, and then passing these settings to other controllers.
    * Going into the fxml and changing the Min/Max height/width through the Border Pane Layout options, and then passing these settings through to other controllers.
