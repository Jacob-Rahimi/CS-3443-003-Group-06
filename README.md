# Command Cyber's Open STIG
Our team here at Command Cyber has developed OpenSTIG, which is a tool designed around the Defense Information Systems Agencyâ€™s (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) that allows users to view, filter, and download STIGs. The main improvements that our application provides compared to the tools that DISA offers is that our application allows STIGs to be downloaded from the application and it is open source to allow users to modify this application to add additional features or incorporate it into their own application.
